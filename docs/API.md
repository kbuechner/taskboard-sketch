Problem:

Create a basic implementation of trello.com task boards.  Trello is a task board that allows you to put tasks on a board, sort them into groups and move them from group to group.  Trello is free, and you can sign up to see it at: https://trello.com/signup.

The goal is not to recreate all the features of Trello, as that would take far too much time for a coding assessment.  Instead, use the basic concept of Trello as a starting point to showcase what you feel are your most relevant skills. 


A REST API is available for this problem.  Please use the following URL: https://dev-game-services.objectiveed.com
To use the service, you will need two things.  The first is your access token for authentication.  Each request should have in its header the key-value pair of “Access-Token” -> XXXXXXXXX.  The second is your boardId.  Both of these will be provided to you in the email you were sent with this test.
